Capstone Project: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success

As part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course, this capstone project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, whereas other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch. Much of the cost savings comes from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets. Therefore, if we can predict whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This information is valuable for alternative companies looking to bid competitively against SpaceX.

In this project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX. I follow the Data Science methodology, which includes:

Data Collection

Data Wrangling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization

Model Development

Model Evaluation

Reporting Results to Stakeholders

The goal is to use data-driven insights and predictive models to help the startup make more informed decisions when bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.
